Benefits for the district

<p>
Availability of Google Fiber in Alameda has the potential to enable many
benefits for Alameda Unified School District, in addition to those described
for our students and the wider Alameda community. Many of these benefits have
common themes of <b>improving efficacy of education delivery</b>, and
<b>improving operational efficiency</b>. These are of paramount importance
in the current education climate, as the educational needs of our students
are changing for the 21st century, and the money available to deliver that
education is constantly shrinking.

<ul>
<li><b>Reducing travel time and cost</b>. Our district includes 10 elementary,
3 middle, and 3 high schools, plus several associated charter schools and an
adult school, distributed across 10 square miles. Staff often travel between
sites to deliver classes or training. By using online delivery, many trips
may be eliminated, saving time and money.
<p>
<li><b>Cross-site access to specialized classes</b>. By delivering certain
classes online, and making them available across school sites via
high-definition video conferencing, the district can simultaneously increase
the number of students who have access to the material, and reduce the cost
of delivery.
<p>
<li><b>Improved staff development</b>. Our teachers and staff continuously
refresh their professional skills and knowledge through staff development and
training. In professional development, we can leverage many of the same
advantages that high-speed internet brings to our students - making use of
streamed or recorded high-definition training content to improve our
efficiency of delivery, and to provide access to external resources from
professional and research institutions, universities, and consultancies.
<p>
<li><b>More efficient outsourcing</b>. By radically increasing the bandwidth
of our connection to the internet, our ability to interact online and securely
share data with external partners is enhanced.
<p>
<li><b>Competition</b>. AUSD has its own private network infrastructure,
currently operated on a backbone leased from a commercial provider.
Availability of Google Fiber will help increase competition in the marketplace
of existing providers (AT&T, Comcast, etc.), which should ultimately benefit
the District, in terms of more favorable lease terms and enhanced
features / capabilities.
