Google Fiber will deliver <b>gigabit internet speeds</b> to island homes
and anchor institutions, enabling <b>high definition video streaming</b>,
<b>interactive video-conferencing</b>, and much faster exchange of data over
the internet. There are many education scenarios that will benefit from this:
<ul>
<li><b>Online homework clubs</b>. Homeworks clubs are popular in our district,
offering students support and encouragement in completing their homework. They
typically require physical attendance on site after school hours, and per-site
volunteers who are available to help. For many students - and several school
sites - that's not practical.  Online clubs using high-definition video
conferencing address both these issues, allowing wider participation both
for students looking for help, and for students, staff, and parents looking
to contribute their support.
<p>
<li><b>Cross-site access to specialized classes</b>. Due to budget realities,
specialized courses such as College Advanced Placement (AP) classes are often
only available at a single school site within AUSD, and with limited
availability. With high-speed internet, lessons can be streamed in real time
between sites, allowing access and participation to a much wider group of
students.
<p>
 <li><b>Access to recorded lesson materials from home</b>. Recording lessons
in high definition is relatively cheap nowadays, thanks to widely available
high-definition cameras. With cloud-based storage and high-speed internet
connections, students can access and review recorded lessons quickly online,
to help them with completing their homework, doing revision, or catching up
on materials missed through absence.
<p>
<li><b>Distance learning</b>. With high-speed connections, access to resources
from other educational institutions, such as leading research institutions,
universities, community colleges, etc., becomes much easier. Our students can
more easily leverage educational resources sourced anywhere in the world, not
just those delivered locally in Alameda.
<p>
 <li><b>Streaming of school events</b>. With gigabit connectivity, live,
high-definition streaming of school events such as graduations, sports meets,
assemblies, etc., becomes possible. While primarily enabling better engagement
with the commmunity, this also offers opportunities for students to participate
in the production and delivery of these events, and learn valuable technical
and production skills while doing so.
<p>
<li><b>Collaboration and sharing</b>. Opportunities for online collaboration
and data sharing are limited today, because local connections are slow. With
local gigabit connectivity, students can easily interact and share data
with others schools in the district, and externally with other institutions.
