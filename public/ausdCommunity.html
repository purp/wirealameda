As an anchor institution in Alameda, the public school district is an
integral part of the fabric of Alameda's community. Availability of gigabit
internet to homes will enable the district to increase its level of
<b>community engagement</b>:
<ul>
<p>
<li><b>Streaming of school events</b>. Parents and other members of the
community often wish to attend school events such as graduations, sports
meets, recitals, and elementary school assemblies, but cannot, due to
schedule or other constraints. With gigabit connectivity, live and recorded
high-definition streaming of all these events becomes possible, making them
accessible to a much broader section of the community.
<p>
<li><b>Improved access to district staff</b>. High definition online
conferencing could provide more convenient ways for parents to interact with
district staff, such as their student's teachers.
<p>
<li><b>Streaming, interactive school board meetings</b>. AUSD's school board
meets twice and month and routinely discusses issues that are of direct
interest to many Alamedans - but physically attending the school board meetings
is impractical for many. The board meetings are currently broadcast on the
local Comcast cable TV system, but many Alamedans do not use Comcast's service.
With gigabit connectivity, board meetings could be streamed online, making them
available to a much higher number of Alamedans, and enabling online
participants to post comments or even address the meeting in real time via
the internet.
<p>
<li><b>Adult School</b>. Many members of Alameda's community participate
in AUSD's <a href="http://www.alameda-adult-school.org/">Adult School</a>.
As students in the adult school, community residents will benefit from
many of the same enhancements as children in our schools, such as increased
access to classes and online materials, and distance learning.
