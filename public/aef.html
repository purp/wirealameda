<p>
The <a href="http://alamedaeducationfoundation.org/">Alameda Education
Foundation</a> believes that every child in the Alameda Unified School
District deserves a well-rounded, high-quality education. A vital force in
AUSD for more than 25 years, we raise funds to provide programs
such as visual and performing arts, sports, AP classes, and scholarships to
schools across the district. Looking ahead, we plan on helping the district
implement both innovations in technology and new 'green' facilities and
programs.
<p>
In common with our partner, <a href="/ausd.html">Alameda Unified
School District</a>, we believe that Google Fiber can have a significant
impact on educational programs in Alameda, helping to further our goal of
ensuring a high-quality education for every child in the district. It can
benefit AEF's specific programs in very direct ways:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
As a charitable foundation, AEF depends entirely on donations to carry on
its work. Our ability to do good for Alameda's students is tied directly to
our ability to market the value of the work we do to the Alameda community
and to regional donors. High definition video streaming of programs and events
within AUSD will greatly increase our ability to engage our donor community,
and demonstrate why they should donate to support our students.
<p>
<li>
Through online conferencing and collaboration, we can broaden access to our
<b>after-school enrichment programs</b>, offering certain classes  to larger
numbers of students distributed across multiple school sites.
<p>
<li>
High definition streaming will help raise the profile of our
<b>middle school sports programs</b> within the Alameda community, which in
turn may allow us to increase their scope.  The programs, which we implemented
when state funding for middle schools sports was cut, offer vital
opportunities for Alameda students to learn sportsmanship, goal-setting, and
discipline. 
</ul>
<p>
We're proud of the results that AEF accomplishes within Alameda Unified School
District, and we're looking forward to the benefits that Google Fiber can bring
to Alameda students.
