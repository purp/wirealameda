<b>AUSD is home to over 10000 students and employees</b>, the vast majority
of whom live in Alameda and represent the full diversity of Alameda's
population. In this island city of just over 70000 people, our school
district is an anchor institution, educating most of the city's children,
and reaching many of its adults through our Adult School.
<p>
<b>Google Fiber high-speed internet can be a gamechanger for education in
Alameda</b>. It has the potential to change the way our students learn,
offering access to educational resources, interaction, and collaboration
that are not possible today, As a public school district that is constantly
being challenged to do more with less, Google Fiber has the potential to
improve many aspects of how we operate, helping us become more efficient
and enhancing our capabilities as educators.
<p>
<b>Alameda is the ideal place for Google to deploy high speed internet</b>,
and Alameda's students and school staff look forward to the benefits it will
provide.
